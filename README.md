# Hackathon2022

# Welcome to the Motoko training! 👻

Hello and welcome to all motivated learners. 🧑‍🎓


# Structure of the week 📆

The training will start on the 19th of July and last until the 28th of July. <br/>

# Lectures 🎬

Lectures will be held live on Zoom Webinar by mentors.
Each lecture will cover one specific topic, most of them will focused around Motoko.

Each lecture will be recorded and available on Discord so you can keep up even if you are not available to watch it live.

# Daily guide 📜

For each day of the training, a guide will be provided.

This guide will contains lessons on multiples Computer Science topics, those lessons are **highly recommended** for begginers, many people participating in this bootcamp have no coding experience and no background in Computer Science; if that's your case we believe it's important to acquire this fundamental knowledge. <br/>
However, don't feel overwhelmed by those topics and make sure to take your time. <br/>
All ressources will stay available after the bootcamp, the core objective of this week is to familiarize yourself with the Internet Computer. <br/> Even for an experimented developer getting familiar with the Internet Computer and being able to develop on it in just one week is already quite challenging.

# Daily challenges 📝

Coding is all about **practice**! <br/>The more you challenge yourself, the better you'll get. 🧑‍💻

Each day along with the daily guide you will also have a list of 10 challenges related to what you'll learn in the lessons. Solutions to these challenges will be released on the following day at 7am EST.<br/>
